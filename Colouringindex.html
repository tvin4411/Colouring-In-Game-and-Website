      <h3>Hello! Welcome to my website where you can download my colouring game!</h3>

    <section id="about">
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>In one of my classes I was tasked to create my very own Creative Coding Project using Processing and for that I decided to develop a colouring game for your computers or laptops.
        <br>Currently there are a total of <strong>8 sketches</strong> which you can paint with <strong>18 different colours</strong> and <strong>2 different types of paint brushes</strong>. But if your want to create your own art, there is also a <strong>blank canvas</strong> option.</p>
        <p>Unfornately, you will not be able to select the sketches you get as it is random.</p>
      <h3>Sketches</h3>

        <h4>As you can tell, this project is not yet that advanced as many other colouring games but I do hope you enjoy it nevertheless!
        <br>And for those who are into coding, the code will be included in the download so you can make your own edits as long as you have Processing.</h4>
