# Colouring-Sketch-Website
University Project 
Hello,
This project of mine is something I created while in University where I'm just practicing my coding skills in terms of HTML, CSS and Processing.
The Game is esentially just a digital colouring-in game with a total of eight sketches that can be painted on at random as well as eighteen different colours and a size scale for the paintbrush (more instructions will be on the website prototype and when you open the game).
As for my website, the theme is based around this Processing game project I had to do for an assignment.
Hope you enjoy it!
Note: Updates may continue if I feel that it is necessary. Thank you.
