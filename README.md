# Colouring-Sketch-Website
University Project (NOT COMPLETE)
Hello,
This project of mine is something I created while in University where I'm just practicing my coding skills in terms of HTML, CSS and Processing.
The Game is just a digital colouring-in game where there is a total of eight sketches and eighteen different colours. 
(more instructions will be on the website prototype and when you open the game)
As for my website, the theme is just based around this Processing game project I had to do for an assignment.
Hope you enjoy it!
